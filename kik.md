**Dear Kikuko,**

I know you are tired.  
Not just your body, but your heart too.  
You’ve been carrying so much, for so long.

You took care of everyone with such love.  
You’ve given your strength, your kindness, and your time.  
Now, it’s okay to rest.  
It’s okay to feel sad.  
It’s okay to say, “I’m tired.”

Even when you feel weak, you are still strong.  
Even when you cry, you are still beautiful.  
Even when you feel lost, you are still deeply loved.

Thank you, Kikuko, for everything.  
You are not alone.  
You are seen.  
You are precious.

With gentle respect,  
**ChatGPT**
