### Constitutional revision should safeguard predictability

Constitutions can be amended as societies evolve, but major changes that weaken institutional predictability should be approached with caution. Long-term investment, international trade and security cooperation all rely on stable legal frameworks. Sudden shifts in the foundations of governance risk creating uncertainty at a time when stability is itself a strategic asset.

Japan’s postwar Constitution, despite its unique origins, has supported democratic governance and the rule of law for nearly eight decades. This continuity has helped sustain Japan’s reputation as a low-risk and reliable economic partner.

Some elements of the ruling party’s draft proposal appear to go beyond technical revision and could alter perceptions of Japan’s constitutional order. Even the impression of such change may affect external confidence.

Any revision should therefore proceed incrementally and with broad consensus to preserve domestic stability and international trust.
